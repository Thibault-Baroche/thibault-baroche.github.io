									<h1>Personal training log from Strava</h1>
								</header>
								
								<p>This project is a dashboard that I created for my personal use. As an outdoor sports enthusiast and endurance athlete, I have been regularly using Strava (a kind of social network for training) since 2013. Today, I have almost 2000 recorded activities on the platform, which beyond the social aspect, serves as a goldmine of information for my training geek side. While Strava does offer analysis functions, they are rather basic and lack of flexibility regarding dates. I wanted to take it a step further.</p>
								
								<p>Indeed, I wanted to be able to answer questions like: </br>
								- In three months, I will be running the same ultra trail that I completed in 2015. At that time of the year, how much distance had I covered while running? Do I have more or less training volume this year?</br>
								- How much elevation gain did I cover in ski mountaineering last winter (from November to April, spanning two calendar years)?</br>
								- Compared to last year at the same time, do I have more or less paragliding flight hours?</br>
								- What is my Top 5 of longer / harder / with more elevation gain trainings by activity ?</br>

								<p>Furthermore, when I finish an activity, my GPS watch automatically syncs with Strava via Bluetooth or Wifi. I wanted my report to update in the same manner, without requiring any additional action on my part.</p>
								
								<p>To achieve this, I used Zapier, which automatically retrieves my training data via the Strava API. These data are stored and processed in Google Sheets, and I used Looker for the visualization part. The report is directly available below, and I delve into the technical details at the bottom of this page.</p>

								<h3>Contextualization</h3>

								<p>Most of the time, I use this report to track the progress of my training compared to the previous year. It allows me to see my totals since the beginning of the year and the month-by-month breakdown. The default time period is "Since the beginning of the year" with a comparison period for the same period last year. The default selected sports are running, cycling, and ski touring because they are the endurance sports that I consider as part of my training. Other activities like hiking or paragliding are included in the report but not in the default segment.</p>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images\Projet_Strava_Screenshot1.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>The top section of the report provides key metrics of interest for the specified time period, along with a comparison to the previous period. The second part allows for a quick overview of the distribution by sports. Since the graphs are interactive, clicking on a specific sport filters the entire report for that activity.</p>
							
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images\Projet_Strava_Screenshot2.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>The bar chart allows tracking the cumulative distance and elevation gain compared to the previous year, providing a visual representation to see my progress throughout the current year at any given moment.</p>
							
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images\Projet_Strava_Screenshot3.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>The last table contains all the activities recorded since 2013. It is particularly useful to find "top activities" based on the chosen criteria. For example, in the image above, it shows skimo activities with the highest elevation gain since 2020. For a comprehensive view of all the details related to an activity (cartography, heart rate zones, etc.), it is possible to directly access them on Strava.</p>

								<p>Therefore, it is a rather descriptive dashboard that allows tracking the progress of training throughout the year and finding activities from previous years for comparison.</p>
